# Red Chillies

![Responsive Mockup](/media/main-img.png)

Red Chillies is an imaginary restaurant reservation web page that brings facilities like reserve online tables, manage their reservations, check menu, and so on. 
It is not an actual site for a restaurant, this is a project to show my coding knowledge and using technologies.

## Restaurant Tables
Creating, updating and deleting tables are at the moment only form admin panel posible.

## Shift(Opening/Closing times)
Creating, updating and deleting Shifts are at the moment only form admin panel posible.

## Register
To access features reserved for members of the website, such as online reservations, users must register. The registration page can be accessed via the link in the navigation bar or through various links available throughout the website.

To become a member, the user needs to provide the following information:

- Username
- Email (Optional)
- Password
- Confirm Password

If the provided information is valid and the username is not already taken, the user is automatically logged in and redirected to the home page. Upon successful registration, a confirmation success message is displayed.

![Singn Up page Mockup](/media/signup.png)

### Create a profile automatically
By default, when a user registers, the system automatically creates a user profile. The admin or super admin can then assign admin permissions to the user if necessary. Note that without a profile, a user cannot book a table.

## Login
If an unauthenticated member wants to use features reserved for members, such as booking a table, they must first log in. The login page can be accessed via the navigation bar or through various links available throughout the website.

To log in, the user must enter:

- Username
- Password

If the username and/or password are incorrect, the form reloads, informing the user of the error. Upon successful login, a confirmation success message is displayed.

![Login page Mockup](/media/login.png)

## Logout
The logout option is visible in the navigation bar when the user is logged in. Clicking the logout button ensures that no one else can access the user's information, especially on a shared or public device.

Upon clicking the logout button:

- The user is immediately logged out and redirected to the homepage.
- The user's session data is cleared.
- Access to secure pages is restricted until the user logs in again.

A confirmation success message is displayed when the user logs out.

## Confirmation Messages
For almost all actions in the system, confirmation messages are used to indicate the result of the action. These can be error or success messages.

![Confirmation alert Mockup](/media/alert.png)

## Personalization
When a user is logged in, their username is displayed on the right side of the navigation bar.

## Footer
The footer displays the copyright text and links to various social media websites. Each link opens in a new tab.

![Footer Mockup](/media/footer.png)

## Additional Features
Features that could be implemented in the future include:

- Notification System: Allow users (both admin and regular users) to receive notifications regarding any changes or new bookings.
- Search Functionality: Search for menu items, categories and bookings.
- Filter/Search Bookings: Filter or search bookings by specific fields.
- Online Food Ordering: Implement an online food ordering system.

## Bugs
- There were no unfixed bugs.

### Fixed Bugs
- Modal Issue for Deleting Reservations: There was a problem with the modal for deleting a reservation where the delete and cancel buttons were not clickable on actual phones, though they worked on computer browsers and different screen sizes. This issue was fixed by removing the modal from being a child of the table.

- Date and Time Picker Issue: The date and time picker was not working with the crispy forms. This issue was resolved by adding form fields in forms.py to allow users to input date and time values with the proper format.

## Development process
In the process of developing this project, I followed agile principles as closely as possible. Various tools and methods were employed to design and analyze the development process.

### Development preparation
- User Stories: Defined what functionalities the system should have.
  - User Stories Link [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/HasibullahFathi/projects/5/views/1)
- Wireframe: Initial design mockups of the pages in the system.

  ![Home page](/media/home-wireframe.png)
  ![Menu page](/media/menu-wireframe.png)
  ![booking page](/media/booking-wireframe.png)

- ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram): Outlined the data needed to work with and the fields of the models.

  ![Booking ERD](/media/booking-ERD.png) ![Menu ERD](/media/menu-ERD.png)

### Agile Development
- Issue Gathering and Analysis: Collected and analyzed issues.
- Breakdown: Split issues into smaller, manageable user stories for easier tracking.
- Acceptance Criteria: Further divided user stories into more manageable and understandable acceptance criteria.
- Prioritization: Ordered user stories based on priority for development.
- Task Management: Used a task board to track progress by moving tasks from "To Do" to "In Progress" and then to "Done" upon completion.

### Git
- Version Control: Used the Code Institute CI-Full Template for version control. [CI-full template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template)
- Commit and Push: Regularly added and committed changes with descriptive and concise comments, then pushed them to Git for version control.
- Issue Resolution: Pulled specific commits to review changes that caused issues when necessary.

## Deployment
The site was deployed on Heroku.

### Preparations
- DEBUG Setting: Set DEBUG to False in settings.py.
- Dependencies: Stored all dependencies in the requirements.txt file using the command: `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Procfile Creation: Created a Procfile with the following command: `echo "web: gunicorn red_chillies.wsgi" > Procfile`

### Deployment Setup
To deploy a project on Heroku, follow these steps:

- Create a Heroku App:
  - Go to the Heroku Dashboard.
  - Click "New" and select "Create new app."
  - Enter a unique name for your app and select a region.

- Configure Environment Variables:
  - Navigate to the "Settings" tab of your Heroku app.
  - Click "Reveal Config Vars" and add the following environment variables:
    - DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: Your Django settings module.
    - DATABASE_URL: Your database URL (if using a database add-on like Heroku Postgres).
    - SECRET_KEY: Your Django secret key.
    - CLOUDINARY_URL: Your Cloudinary API URL (includes API key, secret, and cloud name).

- Add Buildpack:
  - In the "Settings" tab, scroll to the "Buildpacks" section.
  - Click "Add Buildpack" and select heroku/python.

- Deploy from GitHub:
  - Go to the "Deploy" tab.
  - In the "Deployment method" section, select "Connect to GitHub."
  - Search for your project name and connect the repository.

- Choose Deployment Method:
  - You can choose between Automatic Deploys and Manual Deploys. During development, I chose Manual Deploys to deploy changes manually after pushing updates to Git.
